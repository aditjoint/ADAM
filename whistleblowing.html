 <h1>Whistleblowing Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 31, 2025</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  ADAM Consult is committed to maintaining a workplace where all employees and stakeholders can report misconduct, fraud, or violations of the law in good faith without fear of retaliation. This policy aims to encourage openness and transparency in reporting concerns related to illegal or unethical behavior.
</p>

<h2>2. Scope of the Policy</h2>
<p>
  This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, and other stakeholders associated with ADAM Consult. It outlines the process for reporting concerns related to unethical behavior, violations of the law, fraud, or any other matters of concern in compliance with Indian laws, including the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 and the Whistleblower Protection Act, 2011.
</p>
<p>
  While not mandated under Section 177 of the Companies Act, 2013, ADAM Consult adopts this policy voluntarily to promote a transparent and ethical working environment.
</p>

<h2>3. What Should Be Reported?</h2>
<p>The following types of concerns should be reported under this policy:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Fraud or financial mismanagement</li>
  <li>Corruption or bribery</li>
  <li>Unethical business practices or violations of corporate governance</li>
  <li>Violation of any law or regulation, including environmental and safety laws</li>
  <li>Abuse of power or authority</li>
  <li>Discrimination or harassment</li>
  <li>Any other activity that is harmful or detrimental to the interests of the company, its employees, or its stakeholders</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Reporting Mechanisms</h2>
<p>Concerns can be reported through the following channels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Email: <a href="mailto:ls@adamconsult.com">ls@adamconsult.com</a></li>
  <li>Dedicated hotline: +91-2235667733</li>
  <li>In writing to the Whistle Officer / Grievance Officer at the companyâ€™s registered office</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Anonymous complaints will be considered if they contain sufficient information to warrant an investigation.
</p>

<h2>5. Protection Against Retaliation</h2>
<p>
  ADAM Consult strictly prohibits retaliation or discrimination against anyone who reports a concern in good faith. Any individual who engages in retaliatory actions will be subject to disciplinary measures, which may include termination of employment or legal proceedings. Employees or stakeholders who believe they have been subjected to retaliation should report such behavior immediately. Retaliation is treated as a standalone violation under this policy.
</p>

<h2>6. Confidentiality</h2>
<p>
  All reports made under this policy will be handled with the utmost confidentiality. The identity of the whistleblower will be protected to the extent possible, consistent with the need to investigate the concern appropriately. However, confidentiality cannot be guaranteed in certain situations, such as when disclosure is required by law.
</p>

<h2>7. Investigation and Response</h2>
<p>
  All complaints will be assessed by the designated Whistle Officer or Ethics Committee, who will determine the appropriate course of action and ensure a fair and unbiased investigation. The investigation process will be fair, transparent, and conducted in compliance with relevant Indian laws. The person who raised the concern will be kept informed of the progress and outcome of the investigation, while maintaining confidentiality regarding involved individuals.
</p>

<h2>8. Legal Protections Under Indian Law</h2>
<p>
  In India, whistleblowers are protected under the Whistleblower Protection Act, 2011 and other applicable laws, which provide safeguards against retaliation or victimization. Legal protections are also available under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), the Prevention of Corruption Act, and other regulatory frameworks that support ethical disclosures in the public and private sectors.
</p>

<h2>9. Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
  Employees and stakeholders are expected to raise any concerns or report suspected misconduct or violations in good faith. All individuals should cooperate with investigations and act with integrity in addressing such issues.
</p>

<h2>10. Policy Review and Updates</h2>
<p>
  This policy will be reviewed periodically to ensure that it remains effective and compliant with applicable laws and regulations. ADAM Consult reserves the right to modify or update the policy as required.
</p>
