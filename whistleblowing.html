    <h1>Whistleblowing Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> April 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      ADAM Consult is committed to conducting business with honesty and integrity, and we expect all staff to maintain high standards. However, all organizations face the risk of things going wrong from time to time, or of unknowingly harboring illegal or unethical conduct. A culture of openness and accountability is essential in order to prevent such situations occurring and to address them when they do occur.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Policy Scope</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to all individuals working at all levels of the organization, including senior managers, officers, directors, employees, consultants, contractors, trainees, homeworkers, part-time and fixed-term workers, casual and agency staff, and volunteers (collectively referred to as "staff" in this policy).
    </p>

    <h2>3. What is Whistleblowing?</h2>
    <p>Whistleblowing is the disclosure of information which relates to suspected wrongdoing or dangers at work. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Criminal activity</li>
      <li>Danger to health and safety</li>
      <li>Damage to the environment</li>
      <li>Failure to comply with any legal or professional obligation</li>
      <li>Bribery or financial fraud</li>
      <li>Miscarriages of justice</li>
      <li>Deliberate concealment of any of the above</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How to Raise a Concern</h2>
    <p>
      We hope that in many cases staff will be able to raise any concerns with their line manager. However, where you prefer not to raise it with your line manager for any reason, you can contact:
    </p>
    <div class="contact-info">
      <p><strong>Whistleblowing Officer:</strong> <a href="mailto:aditjoint@gmail.com">adamconsultservice@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p><strong>Ethics Hotline:</strong> +91-8080280801</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      Concerns can be raised verbally or in writing. A written report should include the background and history of the concern and reasons for the concern.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      We hope that staff will feel able to voice whistleblowing concerns openly under this policy. However, if you want to raise your concern confidentially, we will make every effort to keep your identity secret. If it is necessary for anyone investigating your concern to know your identity, we will discuss this with you.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Protection for Whistleblowers</h2>
    <p>
      Staff who raise genuine concerns under this policy will not be at risk of losing their job or suffering any form of detrimental treatment as a result. Provided you are acting in good faith, it does not matter if you are mistaken. However, if we conclude that a whistleblower has made false allegations maliciously, the whistleblower will be subject to disciplinary action.
    </p>

    <h2>7. How We Will Respond</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have raised a concern, we will carry out an initial assessment to determine the scope of any investigation. We will inform you of the outcome of our assessment. You may be required to attend additional meetings in order to provide further information.
    </p>
      While we cannot always guarantee the outcome you are seeking, we will try to deal with your concern fairly and in an appropriate way. By using this policy, you can help us to achieve this.
