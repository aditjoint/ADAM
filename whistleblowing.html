    <h1>Whistleblower Policy (India)</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 15, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      This policy is framed in accordance with the provisions of Section 177(9) of the Companies Act, 2013, and the rules made thereunder. It aims to provide a mechanism for employees and stakeholders to report unethical behavior, actual or suspected fraud, or violations of company policies.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Applicability</h2>
    <p>
      This policy applies to all employees, directors, vendors, consultants, interns, and stakeholders of ADAM Consult, across all locations in India.
    </p>

    <h2>3. What Constitutes Whistleblowing?</h2>
    <p>Concerns that may be reported under this policy include but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Violation of any law or regulation (including tax, anti-corruption, or environmental laws)</li>
      <li>Accounting or auditing irregularities</li>
      <li>Misuse or misappropriation of company assets</li>
      <li>Bribery, corruption, or kickbacks</li>
      <li>Sexual harassment or workplace misconduct</li>
      <li>Endangering public health or safety</li>
      <li>Concealment of any of the above</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Reporting Mechanism</h2>
    <p>
      Reports can be made anonymously or with full identity disclosure. The whistleblower may choose to report through:
    </p>
    <div class="contact-info">
      <p><strong>Whistleblower Officer:</strong> <a href="mailto:adamconsultservice@gmail.com">adamconsultservice@gmail.com</a></p>
      <p><strong>Grievance Hotline:</strong> +91-8080280801</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      A detailed written complaint may include the facts, supporting evidence (if any), names of individuals involved, and your relationship with the organization.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Investigation and Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>
      All complaints will be acknowledged and investigated by a designated Whistleblower Committee. The identity of the complainant will be kept confidential unless disclosure is required by law.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Protection Against Retaliation</h2>
    <p>
      ADAM Consult is committed to ensuring that no employee or stakeholder who makes a disclosure in good faith will be harassed, retaliated against, or subjected to unfair treatment. Any reprisal will lead to disciplinary action.
    </p>

    <h2>7. False Allegations</h2>
    <p>
      Whistleblowers must ensure that their allegations are factual and not motivated by personal grievances. False or malicious complaints will be treated as misconduct and dealt with under the disciplinary policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Regulatory Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      This policy aligns with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Companies Act, 2013 (Section 177)</li>
      <li>SEBI (LODR) Regulations, 2015 – for listed entities</li>
      <li>Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Policy Review</h2>
    <p>
      This policy shall be reviewed annually by the management and board, and may be updated based on regulatory changes or operational needs.
